# Basic-Sentiment-Analysis-script-in-Python

This script uses Tweepy for accessing the tweets and Textblob for processing and performing sentiment analysis on the captured data/tweeets.
To get the script working, you need to have the proper keys in place first.
For that you have to create a new application on your twitter dev account.
I have used the sentiment.polarity method of the textBlob library to get the polarity of a tweet.
This script works on python 2.7.9 correctly as on 6/11/17
